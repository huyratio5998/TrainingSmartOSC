    "Description": "This is a minor update release to the MVC Music Store tutorial which corrects some typos and common problems in the 2.0 release. This tutorial is updated for ASP.NET MVC 3 and Entity Framework Code-First, and contains fixes and improvements based on feedback and common questions from previous releases.\n\nThe main download, MvcMusicStore-v2.1.zip, contains everything you need to build the sample application, including\n* A detailed tutorial document in PDF format\n* Assets you will need to build the project, including images, a stylesheet, and a pre-populated database\n* The completed code for the project which shows you how your application will look when finished (this is helpful in case you get stuck)\n\nYou can also download the assets and PDF document separately if desired.\n\nThis tutorial and application are built for Visual Web Developer 2010 or Visual Studio 2010, running against SQL Server Express. A T-SQL create script is available in the Assets folder in case you would prefer to use your own instance of SQL Server 2005 or 2008. The schema in the T-SQL script will only work with the 2.0 and later releases, as the tables have been renamed to pluralize them so they work better with Entity Framework. However, the recommended path is to follow the tutorial and use SQL Express if at all possible.",
