    "Description": "I get the error 'Value cannot be null. Parameter name: source' when adding to cart, and this is this line:\r\n\r\nvar koszykPrzedmiot = sklepBaza.Koszyk.SingleOrDefault(c => c.id_koszyka == id_koszyka_zakupowego && c.id_produktu == produkt.id_produktu);\r\n\r\nNext line is checking if the variable is null, so there must be a possibility that it is so why is it telling me that value cannot be null?",

If you have general questions about this tutial, it's better to ask in the Discussions list, which has support for code snippets, etc. \r\n\r\nSince this question isn't really about MVC Music Store (you're making some changes using products, etc.) I'd recommend asking on StackOverflow, with more source for context. If you don't get an answer, post on the Discussions board with a link to the StackOverflow question, okay?",
