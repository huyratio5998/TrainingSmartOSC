    "Description": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nThanks so much for the fabulous mvc walk through!  I'm learning a lot.\r\n\r\nI did want to let you know about a problem I encountered on page 73 of the tutorial.  When attempting to access the StoreManager/Edit/5 URL, I was unsuccessful in accessing the page.  However, when I attempted to click on one of my 'Edit' links from the working StoreManager page, it displayed a form like what is shown in the .pdf on page 73.\r\n\r\nI was curious, so, I looked inside the Albums table in the database and saw that the database only contained content for AlbumID #386-#669.  Did something happen to the database since the original release?  I'm guessing that the reason my page didn't show up is because my file didn't contain an entry for #5.\r\n\r\nI downloaded a 'fresh' copy of the database to make sure I didn't accidentally delete any data, but, that file also had info for only AlbumID #386-#669.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, I found this problem with the downloaded db today (12/22/2010).\r\n\r\nThanks!",
