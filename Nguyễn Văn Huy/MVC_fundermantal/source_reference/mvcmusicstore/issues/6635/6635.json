    "Description": "As I worked through the tutorial and tested each stage, I noticed that the web page didn't always display properly.\r\nThen I realized that the browser was probably showing an old, cached, page. Refreshing always solved the problem.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the examples should always generate the appropriate no-caching code in their headers. ",
