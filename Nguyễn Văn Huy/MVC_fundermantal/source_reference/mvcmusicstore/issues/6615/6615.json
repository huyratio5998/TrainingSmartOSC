I started with a fork on this project (https://hg01.codeplex.com/forks/coderdennis/mvcmusicstorevb), but moved the fork to its own CodePlex project at http://vbmvcmusicstore.codeplex.com \n\nIt's now complete for version 2.1 and I'll be merging in the version 3.0 changes next. I'd love to have some help as I haven't started modifying the text of the tutorial yet. I learned a lot by just going through the tutorial to get the code to this point.",
