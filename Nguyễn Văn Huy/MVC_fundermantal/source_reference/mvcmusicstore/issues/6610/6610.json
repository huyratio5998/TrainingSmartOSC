Hovewer, little comment:\r\nPage 55\r\n\"We use the [HttpPost] attribute to indicate that this form will only respond to the HTTP-POST \r\nmethod, so it is only displayed when a user submits the form. \"\r\n\r\n\"so it is only displayed when a user submits the form\" - would be better to rephrase or remove this. It is not clear what is displayed. We just return ActionResult. It may be a RedirectToRouteResult or ViewResult  depending on the action execution.",
