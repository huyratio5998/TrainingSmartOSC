    "Description": "I have a question:  In the ShoppingCart class (section 8 of tutorial), you explicitly say we're going to use session, but that it's bad (and I concur).  Like most developers who work on production systems, session is simply not an option for me.  So as I  was looking at adapting this model to use cookies, I noticed this in your code comments:\r\n\r\n        // We're using HttpContextBase to allow access to cookies.\r\n        public string GetCartId(HttpContextBase context)\r\n        {\r\n            if (context.Session[CartSessionKey] == null)\r\n            {\r\n               ...\r\n                    // Send tempCartId back to client as a cookie\r\n                    context.Session[CartSessionKey] = tempCartId.ToString();\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo, am I missing something?  Is the manner in which you're using session somehow using cookies?  Is this load-balancer safe?  \r\n\r\nI guess I'm just confused.  I haven't used session since the ASP days, and based on your comments I'm wondering if I'm confused about the implementation.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJJ",

I worked my shopping cart using MvcMusicStore tutorial and now on my production server the item doesn't get deleted when i click \"remove from cart\".\nI thought it was ajax or jQuery problem since my jQuery lightbox is not working on the production environment too.\nBut its actually a session/cookie problem?",
