    "Description": "The solution turned out to be surprisingly easy.\r\n\r\nInstead of the method described in the tutorial do as follows:\r\n\r\nInstall Powershell for your OS, if not already done.\r\n\r\nIn the solution, click on Tools/Library package Manager/Package Manager Console\r\n\r\nAfter the PM> prompt type\r\n\r\nInstall-Package EfCodeFirst\r\n\r\nThe package gets installed, reading the log file shows that EfCodeFirst is obsolete and EntityFramework was installed instead.\r\n\r\nClose the console window.\r\n\r\nLook at Reference in the Solution Explorer, you should see EntityFramework there.",
