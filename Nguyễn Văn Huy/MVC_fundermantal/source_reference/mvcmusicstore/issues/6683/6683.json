    "Description": "I just tried to do the MvcMusicStore sample and I tried to use a completed sample, which breaks when you try to add an album to a cart. Further investigation has shown that file \"MvcMusicStore-v3.0\\MvcMusicStore-Completed\\MvcMusicStore\\Views\\ShoppingCart\\Index.cshtml\" contains <script> reference to jquery of version 1.4.4 but jquery 1.5.1 is included in the sample, so this reference in this file should be updated to 1.5.1",
