    "Description": "If you try to run fresh new vanilla build of new MVCMusicStore v2.0 in Firefox 3+, the contents part doesn't ever shows up. While looking at the issue, it seems problem in CSS.\r\n\r\nQuick workaround will be removing/commenting-out the \"overflow:hidden\" property from #main style in Site.css. While doing this, it mess up home page a little. But people can get the idea.",
