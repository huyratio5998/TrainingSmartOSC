      "Message": "Thanks Mr Jon Galloway for this sympathic tutorial. Thanks khacnhat for reporting this issue, that i've noticed too. I've tried your solution. It was a good idea but wasn't complete since the process still misfunctioned. Here's a sample of the four files I've slightly modified:\r\n- RemoveFromCart method in ShoppingCart.cs model\r\n- ShoppingCartRemoveViewModel.cs\r\n- RemoveFromCart method in ShoppingCartControler.cs\r\n- View/ShoppingCart/Index.aspx file (both Javascript function and table rows/cells ids to refer as)\r\nTo me, this issue seems fixed now. I hope you would agree. \r\nRegards.",

      "Message": "Yep. noticed this too. Fixed it by having the RemoveFromCart method return an int of items remaining for that line item, and then passing that value to the view.",
