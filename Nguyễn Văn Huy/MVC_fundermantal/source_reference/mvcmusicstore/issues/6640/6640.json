    "Description": "On page 113 of the MVC Music Store Tutorial V2.0 the tutorial explicitly states that the Remove From Cart link will be implemented using\r\n\r\n\r\n@Ajax.ActionLink(\"Remove from cart\", \"RemoveFromCart\",\r\nnew { id = item.RecordId }, new AjaxOptions { OnSuccess = \"handleUpdate\" })\r\n\r\n\r\n However in the ensuing discussion on \"Ajax Updates using Ajax.ActionLink\" that code snippet is never actually used. Why?\r\n\r\nThe actual code used is\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"RemoveLink\" data-id=\"@item.RecordId\">Remove from cart</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen I replaced the generated Html ActionLink with this code then IE presented me with an open File Dialog \r\n\r\nSee my previous discussion of \"RemoveFromCart results in Open file Dialog\"\r\n\r\n1. Why is the Ajax.ActionLink code not used?\r\n\r\n2. What are the differences in usage and behavior of the three different code snippets?\r\n\r\nI sure could use some education on this. I appreciate any help you can offer.",

      "Message": "I'm having issues with this part as well. I didn't have the @Ajax.ActionLink included in the PDF tutorial I'm following so I don't see a use for the \"handleUpdate\" function in the <script>... It's the plain old <a href=\"#\" class=\"RemoveLink\" data-id=\"@item.RecordId\">Remove from cart</a> that takes care of removing from the cart. Now the .click event wired to the anchor's class works. Except when it removes the item, the removed from cart message is displayed but that is all. The cart disappears and I have to go back a few pages to see the cart again. I don't know what the issue is. I tried the @Ajax.ActionLink router but that told me there was no /ShoppingCart/RemoveFromCart for some reason even though there is. Either way, checking the inline javascript I notice references to $('#cart-status') yet I don't see any element with such an Id? Am I missing something?",
