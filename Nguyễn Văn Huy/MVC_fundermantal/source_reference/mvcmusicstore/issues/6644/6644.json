When I changed the name of the connection string to \"MusicDBContext\", it finally worked.  I can't explain why this made a difference because.  I have searched for another reference to this name in my entire solution and found none.  Here is my connection string:\n\n<connectionStrings>\n    <add name=\"MusicDBContext\"\n     connectionString=\"Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESS;Integrated Security=SSPI;AttachDBFilename=|DataDirectory|MvcMusicStore.mdf\"\n     providerName=\"System.Data.SQLClient\"/>\n  </connectionStrings>",
