    "Html": "<p>Hello,<br />In the interest of learning MVC 3, I'd still like to see a response to the OP's questions.&nbsp; It seems to me that the Ajax.ActionLink approach is the more elegant solution than the '.click' event solution.&nbsp; Perhaps the ActionLink approach didn't work or maybe the author just wanted to provide an example of a jQuery wire up?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, I see that even in v3.0 the \"handleUpdate\" function still exists in the completed project.&nbsp; If I understand the 'fixed' code correctly, it was only the Ajax.ActionLink that would call the handleUpdate function (onSuccess), but since the ActionLink has been redacted, the handleUpdate code is superfluous.&nbsp; Is my understanding correct?<br /><br />Thank you.</p>",
