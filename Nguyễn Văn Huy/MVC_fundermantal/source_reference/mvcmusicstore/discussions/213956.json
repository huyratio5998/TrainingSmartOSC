MVC doesn't prevent you from replacing the regular POST calls with AJAX calls, nor does it help much (since it is <em>server</em> technology, and what you want is to change <em>client</em> behavior). Take a look at Ajax.BeginForm() instead of Html.BeginForm(), or $.ajax() calls in jQuery.</p>\r\n<p>Good luck! Your job depends on it!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
