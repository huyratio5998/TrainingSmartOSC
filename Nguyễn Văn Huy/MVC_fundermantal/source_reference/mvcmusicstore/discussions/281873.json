Please share if you have a work around.</p>\r\n<p>I have had luck with the following:</p>\r\n<p>1) Open SDF through Visual Studio \"Connect to DataBase\" option. Then I can browse tables with minimum functionality.</p>\r\n<p>2) Create a MDF DB instead using default SQLExpress engine:&nbsp;A) Delete the existing SDF DB,&nbsp;B) set the SampleData class to inherit from&nbsp;DropCreateDatabaseAlways insead of if model changes (just to force a new DB),&nbsp;C) Delete the entire web.config connectionstring to force default to SQLExpress and MDF.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;add name=\"MusicStoreEntities\"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connectionString=\"Data Source=|DataDirectory|MvcMusicStore.sdf\"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; providerName=\"System.Data.SqlServerCe.4.0\"/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, you can probably change the connection string to \"....
