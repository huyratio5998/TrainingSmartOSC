    "Html": "It depends what kind of scale you're talking about and what you need the data layer to do. There are large sites running on EF and CodeFirst, including the NuGet.org site (which also handles the entire NuGet package feed).\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>EF does add some (albeit small) overhead since it's doing things like change tracking, handling relationships, etc. If you need to optimize further, you have two good options: (1) you can tweak EF to use stored proceudres or views for some specific high-throughput\r\n areas (2) you can use a micro-orm like Dapper (used on StackOverflow.com) or Massive which does less but does it faster.</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>I highly recommend building and performance testing rather than making guesses at the beginning. You can use the Repository pattern to abstract your data access so that moving from or optimizing EF is easy should you need to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div>On Fri, Dec 16, 2011 at 2:56 PM, Phenomin <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a href=\"mailto:notifications@codeplex.com\">notifications@codeplex.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex; border-left:1px #ccc solid; padding-left:1ex\">\r\n<div>\r\n<p>From: Phenomin</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>I just downloaded your tutorial and source and am excited to go through it.
