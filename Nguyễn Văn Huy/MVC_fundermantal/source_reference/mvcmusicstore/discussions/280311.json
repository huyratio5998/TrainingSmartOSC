It's my understanding that by using Entity Framework a project's resources can be scaffolded up so that objects like the database schema, unit and persistence tests,\r\n models and view models can all be generated by MVCScaffolding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm betting that someone within this user group has already scaled that learning curve. While, generically speaking, there are plenty of 'code first' posts and projects - but i haven't found one where GMail's Contact object is that first bit of code. (at risk\r\n of being crass) I'm willing to toss a few hundred dollars to someone who produces a sample (via github, codeplex, googlecode...whatever) that directly implements a tested, db-driven, CRUD-enabled mvc starter project. (even willing to toss a few dozen dollars\r\n to be pointed toward and existing post)(/crassness) .</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>thx</p>\r\n",
