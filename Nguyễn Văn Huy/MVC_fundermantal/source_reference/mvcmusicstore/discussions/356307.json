Why a particular\\each Controller was Required? 2. How these Requirements\r\n were fulfilled? Sl. No Name of Controller 1 Home Controller 2 Store Controller 3 Store Manager Controller 4 Account Controller 5 Shopping Cart Controller 6 Check Out Controller I have read the Music Store pdf document but this is repetitive, Cumbersome and\r\n meant only for Developers. But I am not a developer but rather at a pre-developer stage. I need answers of two questions regarding each of the 6 controllers in a tabular format. I tried to paste a table with four columns and seven rows here. But the table\r\n could not be pasted here. Thanking in anticipation. ",
