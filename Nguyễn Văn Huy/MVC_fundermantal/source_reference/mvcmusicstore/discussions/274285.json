When I browse albums and choose a genre that has a lot of albums in it the album list appears at the bottom (not\r\n floating right). The div statement is &lt;div class=&quot;genre&quot;&gt; but I do not see this in the CSS file. in the PDF the Classical genre is selected and the albums appear correctly in the document. Any pointers.</p>\r\n",
