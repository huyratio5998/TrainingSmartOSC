Thank you</p>\r\n<p>I have been following the step by step instructions in the MVC Music Store tutorial. &nbsp;In page 23 of the tutorial adding a StyleSheet. I've done everything I can possibly see and&nbsp;interpret. I &nbsp;have&nbsp;even started this project over 3 or 4\r\n times up until this point and still can't figure out what I'm doing wrong as to why my layout does not look how your screenshot does on page 27?</p>\r\n<p>Mine still looks like this??? I'm obviously missed something or do I have to continue further for on for it to look how it looks in the screen shots? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I know this is something so simple but I wish to complete this so\r\n I can continue moving along. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Matt&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"x_header\">\r\n<h1>ASP.NET MVC MUSIC STORE</h1>\r\n<ul id=\"x_navlist\">\r\n<li><a id=\"x_current\" href=\"http://localhost:53811/\">Home</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://localhost:53811/Store/\">Store</a> </li></ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2>This is the home page</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&#65279;&#65279;</p>\r\n",
