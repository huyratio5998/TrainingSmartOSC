The web.config approach is a little cleaner for two reasons:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can use your helper in all your views without having to add an import statement</li>\r\n<li>If you put all&nbsp;several helpers in one namespace, you can use them all in all your views without any import statements</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This has actually been available since ASP.NET 2.0, if you can believe it: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164642.aspx\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164642.aspx</a></p>\r\n<p>- Jon</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Compilation worked fine. Never checked&nbsp;the same&nbsp;in VS2008. But just thought it easier, for the intellisense to work, to put it on the page.
