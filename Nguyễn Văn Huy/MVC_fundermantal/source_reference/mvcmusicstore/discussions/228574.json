The warning is not an error, it's just an warning caused when VS checks the links on the page and can't tell if &quot;/Store/&quot; is a valid link.

    "Html": "<p>@dogfacemarc See my answer from Sep 30 above. This warning means that Visual Studio can't verify that the URL is valid, so it's warning you that you need to make sure it's correct. The relative URL is correct, so you can either ignore the warning. If that doesn't sit well with you, you can use Html.ActionLink to generate the URL, which will make the warning go away. You can read more about Html.ActionLink on MSDN: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd493018.aspx\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd493018.aspx</a></p>",
