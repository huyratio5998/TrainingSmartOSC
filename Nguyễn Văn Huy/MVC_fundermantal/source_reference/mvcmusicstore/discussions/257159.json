The same goes for the 'Delete' page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Thanks for the reply. I should have explained my code sample better. While going through the tutorial I followed all of the steps, but instead of a music store I made mine a 'Job Tracker' application. So I changed the name of certain classes like this:<br /> <br /> Artist &gt; Company<br /> Genre &gt; Job Category<br /> Album &gt; Job<br /> <br /> So I built those views against my 'Job' model, consistent with building against the 'Album' model in the directions. I noticed that in the tutorial, the 'Artist' and 'Genre' also do not show up on the detail and delete pages. I think it has something to do  with the fact that 'Artist.Name' and 'Genre.Name' are defined outside of the Album class (which detail.cshtml imports), but I can't figure out how to access those from detail.cshtml.<br /> <br /> <br /> <img src=\"http://www.iarp-florida.org/images/detail.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>And by looking at the code from 'Detail.cshtml' from the finished application, it looks like those values are expected to show:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;div class=\"display-label\"&gt;Genre&lt;/div&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;div class=\"display-field\"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Genre.Name)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;div class=\"display-label\"&gt;Artist&lt;/div&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;div class=\"display-field\"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @Html.DisplayFor(model =&gt; model.Artist.Name)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>THanks.</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Ok, the above issue gets resolved at the point in the tutorial when you mark the Genre and Artist as virtual properties. I'm still not exactly sure why this is, but after adding the 'virtual' keyword, the Genre and Artist fields are displayed normally in  the StoreManager 'Details' and 'Delete' views.<br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> Jonathan</p>",
