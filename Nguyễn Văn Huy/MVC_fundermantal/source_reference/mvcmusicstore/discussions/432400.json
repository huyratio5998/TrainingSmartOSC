I am stuck in <strong>Chapter 03,</strong> where it points out (under the <strong>&quot;Using a Layout for common site elements&quot;</strong> topic) towards the <strong>Shared</strong> folder under the <strong>Views</strong> folder which is automatically being generated . In my case I <strong>did not find</strong> any such folder. There is only Views folder underneath which Home folder and web.config file is present.\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease help me in this regard.\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRegards<br />\n",

    "Html": "Yes I ran into this to.  It seems to be an issue between MVC 3 empty template and MVC 4 empty template, which you probably chose \r<br />\n<br />\nSo what I did was just download the complete solution and added the folder and the _Layout.cshtml\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nhere is the code if you can't download the solution <br />\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;@ViewBag.Title&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link href=&quot;@Url.Content(&quot;~/Content/Site.css&quot;)&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;script src=&quot;@Url.Content(&quot;~/Scripts/jquery-1.5.1.min.js&quot;)&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=&quot;@Url.Content(&quot;~/Scripts/modernizr-1.7.min.js&quot;)&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    \n      &lt;script src=&quot;@Url.Content(&quot;~/Scripts/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js&quot;)&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  \n    @RenderSection(&quot;Scripts&quot;, required: false)\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div id=&quot;header&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;\n            ASP.NET MVC MUSIC STORE&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;ul id=&quot;navlist&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;li class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/&quot; id=&quot;current&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/Store/&quot;&gt;Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    @RenderBody()\n\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nYou are also going to want to add a Scripts directory from the root as I don't think the empty template did this then add the jquery scripts.  To get them you can create a new MVC4 solution but pick Intranet as your template and it will create the script folder Shared and _ViewStart<br />\n",

    "Html": "mbova is correct about the empty template being different.  MVC4 is definitely empty.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, another solution is to just start over and choose &quot;Basic&quot; instead of &quot;Empty&quot; on the &quot;New ASP.NET MVC 4 Project&quot; window.  That gets you the scripts, content and shared, _layout.cshtml, etc. folders and files.  You can also choose &quot;Internet Application&quot; to get a few more bells and whistles on top of &quot;Basic&quot; like the user controls.<br />\n",
