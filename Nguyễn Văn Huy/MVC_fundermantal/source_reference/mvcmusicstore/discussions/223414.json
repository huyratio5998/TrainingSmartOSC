LOTS to learn all at once, so I'm following the tutorial very carefully. On page 75, there is this code:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:green\">// Display the confirmation message</span>\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">var</span> results = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> ShoppingCartRemoveViewModel {\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>What the...? How'd I miss that??</p>\r\n<p>I didn't. In searching the PDF for &quot;ShoppingCartRemoveViewModel&quot;, the FIRST (and LAST) instance of it is the line of code I cited above. No direction in the tutorial to add the ShoppingCartRemoveViewModel class or the code this class should contain.</p>\r\n<p>Well, I'll download the project's source code because for sure the file will be there, and I'll graft the ShoppingCartRemoveViewModel.cs file into my project and that should get me back on track, but I sure hope the tutorial gets fixed so the next guy doesn't have to go on the same wild goose chase through the tutorial as I. Diversions like this are a real buzzkill.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Chuck</p>",
