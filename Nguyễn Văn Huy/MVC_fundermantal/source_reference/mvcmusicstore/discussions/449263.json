I know one takes a string and the other an int as arguments but in the tutorial, we go to /Store/Details/5 for the Details and for the Browse method, /Store/Browse?Genre=Disco\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyone know the difference and why we can't go to /Store/Browse/Disco instead of passing it as a querystring parameter.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers<br />\n",
