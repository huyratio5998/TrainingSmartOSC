It sets up all table names in singular, where the application sample code expects all the table names to be in plural.</p>\r\n<p>The script also starts with a whole lot of DROPs, that generate errors of course if you start with an empty database. Can I suggest that there are IF EXISTS put around that?</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Gerard</p>\r\n",
