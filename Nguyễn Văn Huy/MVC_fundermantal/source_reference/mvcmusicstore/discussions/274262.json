Is that true? If yes, i did'nt find any database created. So haw does it works,\r\n all that staff is on the memory?</p>\r\n<p>3) If we wanted to work with EF but ommitting the Code First pattern, i.e we have an existing DataBase and we want to work with this DataBase and create classes that maps to theses tables, how can I do this?</p>\r\n<p>4) When membership security is a good choice, and in a real world environement, how could I create the ASP.NET Memebership DataBase ?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much!</p>\r\n",
