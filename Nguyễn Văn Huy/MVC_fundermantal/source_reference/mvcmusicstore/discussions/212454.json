For myself, I would find it helpful if links or references could be included in the documentation to more information on the topic being presented, e.g. the Metadata Type Attribute. This is certainly something I had not run into before and although I understand the overall concept, as explained in the msdn, how do I know what attributes are applicable/usable in the metadata class?</p>\r\n<p>Another topic that I am having some trouble understanding right now is why/how&nbsp;the Client Side Validation with Javascript works.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the tutorial. It is one of a very few that I have found for VS 2010.</p>",
