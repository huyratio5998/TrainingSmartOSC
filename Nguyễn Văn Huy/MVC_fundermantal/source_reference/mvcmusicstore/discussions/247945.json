    "Html": "<p>borge -&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Glad you're enjoying the tutorial!</p>\r\n<p>The @model is a directive which sets the Model type for the view. It's similar to what you'd see in a &lt;% Page %&gt; declaration at the top of an ASPX page. Model is a property of the page which allows accessing information in the view. They're related, but not the same thing.</p>\r\n<p>There are a few primers on the Razor syntax:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There's a long-ish overview in the WebMatrix tutorials here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/tutorials/2-introduction-to-asp-net-web-programming-using-the-razor-syntax\">http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/tutorials/2-introduction-to-asp-net-web-programming-using-the-razor-syntax</a></li>\r\n<li>Phil Haack has compiled a quick reference here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/06/razor-syntax-quick-reference.aspx\">http://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/06/razor-syntax-quick-reference.aspx</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The best advice I can give you on Razor is to avoid thinking of it as another programming language to be learned. Think about it as a lightweight syntax that allows you to execute code within a view, using .NET languages that have been around for a long time.</p>",
