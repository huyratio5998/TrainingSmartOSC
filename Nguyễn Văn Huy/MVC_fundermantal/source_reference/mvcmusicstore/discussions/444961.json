The same instruction  is then repeated  at page 121: “ Right-click on the Models folder and add a class named Order”. If there is only one Order.cs, then the 2nd  instruction should be: “Open the file Order.cs”. Or, perhaps there may be two files named the same: Order.cs. Please clarify this confusion.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you<br />\n",
