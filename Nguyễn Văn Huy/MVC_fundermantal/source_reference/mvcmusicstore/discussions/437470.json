It may be a language problem (I'm french). I know I could follow the entire tutorial : I'll do it asap.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a demo version of MVC Music Store online somewhere, so that I can at least see it in action ?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance for any answer. Regards,\r<br />\n  Baptiste<br />\n",
