Even After using the mdf file and changing the connection string to use it, now I get this error:</p>\r\n<p>Server Error in '/' Application.<br />Model compatibility cannot be checked because the database does not contain model metadata. Ensure that IncludeMetadataConvention has been added to the DbModelBuilder conventions.</p>\r\n<p>I didn't want to spend more time troubleshooting another issue.</p>\r\n<p>I noticed a file called MvcMusicStore-Create.sql. I didn't see a reference to it in the tutorial or source code so I don't know what its purpose. Also the table names in the script are in plural while the tables names in the mdf file are singular. Conclusion: not the script that populated the mdf? All this is making things more confusing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I downloaded and installed SQL CE and the app works now.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
