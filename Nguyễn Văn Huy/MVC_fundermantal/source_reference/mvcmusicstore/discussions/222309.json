I go through the tutorial step by step...\r\nNow I have a problem:\r\n\r\nThere is a method for generate some html code depending on the object.\r\n\r\nOk..\r\nHtml.EditorFor(m =&gt; m.Album,...) generates some html code for Album type. By reflection (if there is no EditorTemplate code ...) or using EditorTemplates Album.ascx.\r\n\r\nThe question is here -&gt; ... in Html.EditorFor method.  Why signature of my method Html.EditorFor doesn;t have the second parameter object for the anonymous type new {Artists = .. , Genres = ...}? There are two other overloaded methods, that takes a string as parameters... Whats wrong?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nKarol Bladek",
