I have several pages and functions in my code that&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;uses the database.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Everything works well during chapter 7 of the tutorial. I can create users and roles and the schema gets autogenerated. Every time that I go to a page that requires authentication, the logon pages comes up as expected. However, after clicking the &quot;log on&quot;\r\n button, the same page gets reloaded. No sign of a failed or a&nbsp;successful&nbsp;logon. It's just the same page. (I saw some people had the same issue, but never reported how to fixed).</p>\r\n<p>Following the code, I noticed that this function never gets called. I assume it should:</p>\r\n<p>public ActionResult LogOn(LogOnModel model, string returnUrl)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any hints?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Montes</p>\r\n",
