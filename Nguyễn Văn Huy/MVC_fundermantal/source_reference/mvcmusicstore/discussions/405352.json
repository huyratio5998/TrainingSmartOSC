Even though the ajax post gets executed which does a precheck to see if recordToDelete is null, by the time the key:value eg. id:22 get routed to RemoveFromCart() the value is null. I've modified global.asax\r\n routing to&nbsp;new { controller = &quot;Home&quot;, action = &quot;Index&quot;, id = -1 } and the debugger shows me -1 is passed to RemoveFromCart() but that doesn't help solve the problem</p>\r\n",
