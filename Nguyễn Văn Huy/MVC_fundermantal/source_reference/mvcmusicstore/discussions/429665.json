It is not very basic in the sense that I had to face a couple of configuration issues which were not mentioned even in the document. Since I have been into .NET development for some time now so\r\n I could sort out those issues myself.</p>\r\n<p>The only thing which I couldn't resolve (or perhaps I didn't bother to resolve) was a design issue in views/home/index.cshtml and views/store/browse.cshtml views. The list of albums is displaying below the 'Genre' menu bar instead of showing on its right.</p>\r\n<p>But still, thanks for the tutorial.</p>\r\n<p>Sumit Mehta</p>\r\n<p>http://www.sumitmehta.net</p>\r\n",
